/*
--------------Purpose-------------
This mapping helps decouple our domain model (Employee) from what we expose to the outside world (EmployeeDto).
This is a good practice because:
-It prevents leaking internal structures.
-we can control what data gets sent to the client.
-DTOs can be customized for different use cases (e.g., hiding sensitive fields).
